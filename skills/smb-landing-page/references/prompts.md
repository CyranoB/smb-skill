## Business Archetype Detection

After the user describes their business, classify it into one of these archetypes. Use the archetype to select conditional interview questions and adapt the landing page outline.

| Archetype | Examples | Key Trait |
|---|---|---|
| **Home / Personal Services** | Babysitter, house cleaner, dog walker, tutor, nanny, pet sitter | Goes to the customer's location; schedule-based availability |
| **Skilled Trades** | Plumber, electrician, HVAC, roofer, handyman, painter, locksmith | Licensed/insured work; emergency and scheduled jobs |
| **Retail / Storefront** | Salon, barbershop, bakery, boutique, florist, dry cleaner | Fixed location with walk-in or appointment hours |
| **Food & Beverage** | Restaurant, cafe, food truck, caterer, meal prep, juice bar | Menu-driven; dine-in, takeout, delivery, or catering |
| **Professional Services** | Accountant, lawyer, consultant, photographer, real estate agent | Expertise-based; appointments or project engagements |
| **Fitness / Wellness** | Personal trainer, yoga studio, massage therapist, chiropractor | Class schedules, memberships, certifications |

If a business straddles two archetypes, pick the one that best matches their primary revenue model. If truly ambiguous, ask the user.

## Interview Questions

### Round 1 — Universal (always ask)

1. What is your business name?
2. What does your business do? *(Use this answer to detect the archetype.)*
3. What area do you serve? *(City, neighborhood, radius, or "customers come to us.")*
4. Who is your ideal customer? *(Age range, situation, need — whatever comes naturally.)*
5. What makes you different from your competitors? *(Even one thing is fine.)*

### Round 2 — Archetype-Specific

After detecting the archetype, ask the relevant follow-ups below. Skip any question the user already answered in round 1.

**Home / Personal Services**
- How many years of experience do you have?
- Do you have any certifications, background checks, or special training?
- What is your typical availability? (Weekdays, evenings, weekends?)

**Skilled Trades**
- Are you licensed, insured, or bonded?
- Do you offer emergency or after-hours service?
- Do you work with residential, commercial, or both?
- What are your top 3-5 services?

**Retail / Storefront**
- What are your hours of operation?
- Do you take walk-ins, appointments, or both?
- Do you have any signature products or services?

**Food & Beverage**
- What type of cuisine or food do you serve?
- Do you offer dine-in, takeout, delivery, catering, or a combination?
- What are your hours?
- Would you like to feature menu highlights on the page?

**Professional Services**
- What are your specialties or practice areas?
- Do you offer a free initial consultation?
- What credentials or certifications should visitors know about?

**Fitness / Wellness**
- Do you run on a class schedule or by appointment?
- What certifications do you hold?
- Do you offer packages, memberships, or drop-in rates?
- Do you work in-person, virtually, or both?

### Round 2 — Optional (offer to all archetypes)

- Do you want to include pricing on your page?
- Do you have testimonials or reviews you'd like to feature?
- Any awards, certifications, or credentials to highlight?
- What is the main action you want visitors to take? *(Call, book online, fill out a form, visit your location?)*

### Interview Delivery

- Present round 1 questions as a conversational group, not a numbered checklist.
- If the user volunteers a lot of information upfront, acknowledge it and only ask what's still missing.
- Keep round 2 short — 3-5 follow-up questions plus the optional ones. Don't overwhelm.
- If the user is unsure about an answer, help them with examples from their archetype (e.g., "Most plumbers highlight licensed & insured, free estimates, and same-day service — does any of that apply to you?").

## Landing Page Outline Format

Generate each section using the template below. Adapt, skip, or merge sections based on the business type adaptation table.

### General template per section

```
## [Number]. [Section Name]
> Purpose: [Why this section exists — what job it does for the visitor]

**Headline:** [Suggested headline text — benefit-first, in the business owner's voice]
**Subheadline:** [One sentence expanding on the headline]
**Content:**
- [Bullet points describing what goes in this section]
- [Use the owner's actual details, not placeholders]
**CTA:** [Call-to-action text and action type, if applicable]
```

### Section specifications

#### 1. Hero / Above the Fold

> Purpose: Immediately tell visitors what the business does, where, and what to do next.

- **Headline:** Business name + core value proposition. Include the service area. Example: "Austin's Most Trusted Plumber Since 2008"
- **Subheadline:** One sentence expanding on the promise or the customer benefit.
- **Trust signals:** 2-3 quick badges — years in business, license/certification, star rating, number of customers served.
- **Primary CTA:** The single most important action. Use a strong verb: "Call Now," "Book Online," "Get a Free Quote," "Schedule a Visit."
- **Location callout:** "Serving [Area]" — critical for local businesses and local SEO.

#### 2. Services / What We Do

> Purpose: Show the range of offerings so visitors can self-qualify.

- **Format:** 3-6 services, each with a name and 1-2 sentence description.
- **Guidance:** Lead with the most popular or profitable service. Be specific — "Drain Cleaning & Sewer Repair" is better than "Plumbing Services."
- **Archetype variations:**
  - Food & Beverage → "Our Menu" or "Menu Highlights" with 4-6 signature items
  - Retail/Storefront → "Our Services" with pricing if the owner opted in
  - Home Services → List the specific services offered (e.g., "Infant care (0-12 months)," "After-school pickup," "Overnight stays")

#### 3. About / Our Story

> Purpose: Build trust through human connection. SMBs win on personality.

- **Content:** Owner's name, how long they've been doing this, what makes them passionate about the work, any family or community angle.
- **Voice:** First person. "I started this business because…" is more effective than "Founded in 2015, XYZ Corp…"
- **Photo suggestion:** Recommend the owner include a photo of themselves or their team at work.

#### 4. Why Choose Us / Trust Builders

> Purpose: Overcome the "why not pick the first Google result" objection.

- **Format:** 3-4 differentiators as benefit-focused bullet points.
- **Pull from:** The owner's answer to "what makes you different" plus archetype-appropriate trust signals.
- **Examples by archetype:**
  - Trades: "Licensed & Insured," "Same-Day Service," "Free Estimates," "10-Year Warranty"
  - Home Services: "Background Checked," "CPR Certified," "Flexible Scheduling"
  - Professional: "15 Years of Experience," "Free Initial Consultation," "Specializing in [Niche]"
  - Food: "Locally Sourced Ingredients," "Family Recipes Since 1995," "4.8★ on Google"

#### 5. Testimonials / Social Proof

> Purpose: Let other customers do the selling.

- **Format:** 2-3 testimonial blocks. Each has: customer first name, context (neighborhood or service used), and a short quote.
- **If the owner provided testimonials:** Use them verbatim.
- **If not:** Provide placeholder structure with coaching: "A strong testimonial mentions a specific result — e.g., 'Mike fixed our furnace in two hours on a Sunday. Lifesaver.' Ask 2-3 happy customers for a quick quote."
- **Bonus:** If the business has Google/Yelp reviews, suggest embedding a star rating + review count.

#### 6. Service Area / Location

> Purpose: Help visitors confirm "do they serve my area?" Critical for local SEO.

- **Storefront businesses:** Physical address, embedded map suggestion, parking/transit notes.
- **Mobile/on-site services:** List of neighborhoods, cities, or zip codes served. "We come to you" messaging.
- **Radius-based:** "Serving a [X]-mile radius around [City]."
- **Multiple locations:** List each with address and hours.

#### 7. Hours & Availability

> Purpose: Reduce friction — visitors need to know when they can reach you.

- **Include for:** Retail/storefront, food & beverage, and any business with set hours.
- **Skip for:** Babysitters, consultants, photographers, and other by-appointment businesses. Instead, fold availability into the CTA: "Book a time that works for you."
- **Format:** Simple day-by-day hours table. Note holidays or seasonal changes. Add "Call for emergency service" for trades that offer it.

#### 8. Pricing

> Purpose: Set expectations and pre-qualify visitors.

- **Include only if** the owner opted in during the interview.
- **If opted in:** "Starting at" pricing, package tiers, or service-by-service rates. Keep it simple.
- **If opted out:** Replace this section with a **"Get a Free Quote" CTA block** — headline, one-liner about easy quoting, and a call/form CTA.
- **Archetype defaults:**
  - Trades → "Free Estimates" CTA (most trades don't show prices)
  - Professional → "Free Consultation" CTA
  - Fitness → Show package/membership pricing (expected in this industry)
  - Food → Link to full menu or show price ranges

#### 9. FAQ

> Purpose: Handle objections, reduce support calls, help SEO.

- **Format:** 4-6 question-and-answer pairs.
- **Always consider these defaults:**
  - "What areas do you serve?"
  - "How do I book / schedule?"
  - "What forms of payment do you accept?"
  - "Are you licensed / insured?" (if applicable)
- **Archetype-specific FAQs:**
  - Trades: "Do you offer free estimates?" "Are you available for emergencies?" "Do you guarantee your work?"
  - Food: "Do you take reservations?" "Do you offer catering?" "Can you accommodate dietary restrictions?"
  - Home Services: "Are you background checked?" "What ages do you work with?" "What's your cancellation policy?"
  - Fitness: "Do I need to bring my own equipment?" "Do you offer trial sessions?" "Can I freeze my membership?"
  - Professional: "What does a typical engagement look like?" "Do you offer payment plans?"

#### 10. Contact / Final CTA

> Purpose: Convert. This is the last chance.

- **Phone number:** Prominent, click-to-call on mobile. Most SMB customers still prefer to call.
- **Email address**
- **Contact form suggestion:** Name, phone, brief message. Keep it short — long forms kill conversions.
- **Physical address:** If applicable (storefront businesses).
- **Social media links:** If the business is active on social.
- **CTA:** Repeat the hero CTA. Same verb, same energy.

#### 11. Footer

> Purpose: Housekeeping and secondary navigation.

- Business name, address, phone, email
- Social media icon links
- License or registration numbers (if applicable)
- "Proudly serving [Area]"
- Copyright line

## Copy Tone Guidelines

### Voice
- Write like a friendly neighbor, not a corporation.
- Use "I" for sole proprietors, "we" for teams. Never "the company" or "the firm."
- Short sentences. Plain words. No jargon.

### Local SEO
- Work the city or area name into headlines and body copy naturally.
- Example: "Trusted Plumbing in North Austin" — not "Trusted Plumbing Services for Residential and Commercial Clients."

### CTAs
- Lead with action verbs: **Call, Book, Get, Schedule, Visit, Order.**
- Avoid weak CTAs like "Learn More," "Submit," or "Click Here."
- Include the phone number directly in CTA text when relevant: "Call (512) 555-0123."

### Assumptions
- When the owner didn't provide specific information, make reasonable assumptions and flag them clearly: *"[Assumption: You serve the greater Austin metro — adjust if this is different.]"*
- Never invent testimonials. Use placeholder structure instead.
